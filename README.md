## Authorship Attribution with Text Classification

This project applies machine learning and deep learning models to tackle the task of **authorship attribution** for tweets, distinguishing between those authored by Donald Trump and his staffers using metadata and text features. A **binary classification framework** is employed, leveraging traditional algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **SVM**, alongside advanced neural networks such as **FFNN** and **DistilBERT**, to predict authorship.

By preprocessing tweet metadata and applying feature engineering, the project explores linguistic patterns and sentiment to improve classification accuracy. It highlights the effectiveness of **NLP techniques**, feature engineering, and advanced models like **DistilBERT**, showcasing the benefits of combining classical and modern approaches for text classification.
